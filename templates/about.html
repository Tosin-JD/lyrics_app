                            with everyone else.

                            I believe in Christ Jesus and that he died and rose again.
                            If we put our faith in him, we will have eternal life.

                            I am a developer with skills in Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS,
                            and Bootstrap. I am very passionate about learning Artificial
                            Intelligence and that is the next line for me.
                            I can use both Django and Flask frame work of Python,
                            while I code in Vanilla JavaScript probably because,
                            frontend is not really my thing.
